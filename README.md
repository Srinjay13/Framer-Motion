* Comparisons (Framer Motion vs GSAP)
* Real React component demos
* Step-by-step animations

Think of it as your **personal animation textbook**, written in an easy and friendly tone.

These notes help beginners understand:

* How Framer Motion works
* When to use which animation method
* How to integrate animations in React apps

## 🎯 Why These Notes Exist

Learning animations can be confusing at first — too many props, too many hooks, and too many ways to do the same thing.

These notes solve that by being:

* **Simple**
* **Desi language–friendly**
* **Straight to the point**
* **Example-driven**

Your future self (and other developers) can quickly copy-paste working code, understand the idea, and start building immediately.
